# Instagram metadata analysis
This script analyses data downloaded from meta, specifically to check whose followers in instagram are also following.
When a large number of following and followers are involved, it becames pretty difficult to analyse the relationship between them. Specially with meta limits to API access and the bot detection system. With this script you can safely retrieve all your data from meta (manually) and, afterwards, make the analysis offline, without the risk to be baned of ghosted from the app.
